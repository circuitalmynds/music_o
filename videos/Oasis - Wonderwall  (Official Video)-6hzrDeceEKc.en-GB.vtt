00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:40.538
Today is gonna be the day

00:00:40.538 --> 00:00:43.040
That they're gonna throw it back to you

00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.303
By now you should've somehow

00:00:46.303 --> 00:00:48.303
Realised what you gotta do

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.160
I don't believe that anybody

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.524
Feels the way I do about you now

00:01:00.832 --> 00:01:02.658
Backbeat the word is on the street

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:04.948
That the fire in your heart is out

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.267
I'm sure you've heard it all before

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:11.455
But you never really had a doubt

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:14.698
I don't believe that anybody feels

00:01:14.698 --> 00:01:18.087
The way I do about you now

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:26.117
And all the roads we have to walk are winding

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:31.906
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding

00:01:33.387 --> 00:01:37.995
There are many things that I would like to say to you

00:01:37.995 --> 00:01:40.500
But I don't know how

00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:48.358
Because maybe

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:54.000
You're gonna be the one that saves me

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
And after all

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.150
You're my wonderwall

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:13.238
Today was gonna be the day

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:15.725
But they'll never throw it back to you

00:02:16.605 --> 00:02:18.773
By now you should've somehow

00:02:18.773 --> 00:02:20.773
Realised what you're not to do

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.367
I don't believe that anybody

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:26.367
Feels the way I do

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:28.203
About you now

00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:36.623
And all the roads that lead you there were winding

00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:42.503
And all the lights that light the way are blinding

00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:48.432
There are many things that I would like to say to you

00:02:48.432 --> 00:02:50.887
But I don't know how

00:02:54.552 --> 00:02:58.469
I said maybe

00:02:58.766 --> 00:03:04.123
You're gonna be the one that saves me

00:03:04.444 --> 00:03:09.000
And after all

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.501
You're my wonderwall

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:20.551
I said maybe

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:26.084
You're gonna be the one that saves me

00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:31.079
And after all

00:03:31.646 --> 00:03:35.894
You're my wonderwall

00:03:38.782 --> 00:03:42.502
I said maybe

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:48.138
You're gonna be the one that saves me

00:03:48.413 --> 00:03:53.837
You're gonna be the one that saves me

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:59.452
You're gonna be the one that saves me
